# AutoQuad FC
This is a fork of original AutoQuad firmware for multicopter flight control which can be compiled by [GNU Tools for ARM](https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded). Currently the binaries are only tested on ground, no flight tests have been performed yet. **USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!**

## Compiling
Clone this repo and before typing `make`, make sure to modify the makefile to set correct toolchain path. Then a simple `make` command should build the binary.
